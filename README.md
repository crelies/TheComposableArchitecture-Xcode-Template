This repository contains a SwiftUI Xcode template for [The Composable Architecture (short: TCA)](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

Quickly create all components of a TCA stack using the template in Xcode and focus on implementing your feature üöÄ

## üõ† How to use

**0.** Check out this git repository on your local machine and navigate into its root directory.

---

**1.** Add the template to **your currently selected Xcode** through running the following command:

```swift install.swift```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention:** *macOS* includes a lot of security features, one of them limits *the access rights a tool has to the data on your disk*.
By default macOS **prevents** applications from writing data to your disk. A user needs to explicitly grant permission to allow writing to the disk.
That's why the above command might fail in your terminal application. You could grant your terminal application *full disk access* to allow it to write to your disk through the *system settings of macOS*:

![macOS system settings - full disk access](https://github.com/crelies/TheComposableArchitecture-Xcode-Template/blob/feature/1.7.x/full-disk-access.jpg)

If the script still fails after granting *full disk access* to your terminal application you can still **manually copy** the `Composable Architecture.xctemplate` directory into
the directory `/Applications/<Your-Xcode>.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Application`.

---

**2.** Open the `New file` wizard in Xcode and select `Composable Architecture` in the `Application` section at the top (it's the same for every platform (iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS)).

---

## ü§î Keep in mind

1. If you install a new Xcode version you have to run the above install script again because this custom template comes not bundled with a new Xcode version üòâ Maybe it should üòÇ What do you think?
2. This template is a **file template**, so you only see it **when using the `New file` wizard in Xcode**! I know that this is confusing because the template directory itself is stored inside of the *project templates directory* of Xcode.
